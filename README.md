# SRGAN-Emotion
Super Resolving low resolution images with faces for training and classification. (In Progress)

This project involves comparison of the performance of low resolution dataset and a super resolved dataset on Deep Learning Models. The low res dataset is created using YouTube videos and labelled. This data is then super resolved using SRGAN.

Implementation of SRGAN based on Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network.
