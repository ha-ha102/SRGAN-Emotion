# SRGAN-Emotion
Super Resolving low resolution images with faces for training and classification. (In Progress)

This project involves comparison of the performance of low resolution dataset and a super resolved dataset on Deep Learning Models. The low res dataset is created using YouTube videos and labelled. This data is then super resolved using SRGAN the implementation of which is based on Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network. SRGAN is trained on the DIV2K dataset. (Tensorflow based implementation)
